# Sphinx overview

**Sphinx** (**S**QL **Ph**rase **In**de**x**) is an open source *full text search server* (i.e. a specialized software 
system designed to efficiently index, store, and retrieve textual data from 
large volumes of documents or content), designed from the ground up with performance, 
search quality, and integration simplicity in mind. Sphinx lets you either batch index and
search data stored in an SQL database, NoSQL storage, or just files. It's written in C++ 
and works on Linux, Windows, macOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, and a few other systems.

# Brief history

1. **Early Development (2001-2005)**: Sphinx was initially developed by Andrew Aksyonoff in 2001 as 
a response to the limitations of existing full-text search solutions. The first public release of
Sphinx occurred in 2005.

support for distributed searching, advanced query syntax, and integration with various database

3. **Version 2.0 (2011)**: Here support for real-time indexing and native JSON support were included.
4. **Version 3.0 (2017)**: Key members of the original Sphinx team formed a fork of the project called
