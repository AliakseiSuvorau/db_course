# Database engine

A database engine (or storage engine) is the underlying software component
that a DBMS uses to execute CRUD requests. 

The Sphinx Search Engine has its own proprietary database engine - [**SphinxQL**](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current/sphinxql-reference.html), developed
specifically to provide fast and efficient full-text search. This engine
is designed to work with indexes optimized for text search, and it
supports various features and capabilities such as weighting coefficients,
result sorting, and more. One can notice that **SphinxQL** is similar to SQL.
